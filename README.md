# <Your-Project-Title>
License Program
## Description

This application will allow users to generate a license badge as well as a link to their license.

- My motivation for creating this application was to make a quick and easy way for developers find and create badges through the application

- The application solves the problem of having to go to multiple websites to find your badges and your links, that can all be generated here
- Through my time working on this application, I have learned how to make a quick and easy way for developers to find their badges and I have made it so it does not take up too much time



## Installation

Al that is required to install the application is to search it's name in a web browser, "License Program", and install the program onto your personal computer or mobile device.
